/// This is a (hopefully) temporary adapter that takes a Apptentive V11 API engagement manifest
/// and updates the TextModal (Note) interactions so that the actions (buttons) engage an event
/// (named `button_<interaction_id>` rather than having to evaluate a list of invocations
/// (which, incidentally, always consist of at most one interaction with empty criteria).
///
/// The invocations are then copied to the targets section under the event's code point name.
/// The end result is that the same invocations get evaluated, but we don't need a special code
/// path to make it happen, we just engage an event on the button tap like we do for the Love Dialog.
///
/// This should be removed once the API can send us pre-transfored engagement manifests.
/// - Parameter input: The engagement manifest to transform.
/// - Returns: The transformed engagement manifest.
